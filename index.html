        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>
            Our goal is to inform residents about Flock and other surveillance so that they may act to protect their privacy.  This system 
            was installed in Joplin with hardly a peep.  If you look, you'll find no news stories and <a href="../posts/2026-01-03-Joplin-Contract-Mystery.html">few traces</a> in council records about Flock's installation.  
            In fact, the official response from the city to our records request included no information from council records about Flock.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe Flock's system is inappropriate in a free and open democracy and should be removed from our city.  The city has also failed to be transparent
            along the way and should be scrutinized for their implementation of this system.
        </p>
        <div id="Why">
            <h2>What Are We Doing and Why?</h2>
            <p>            
                Flock Safety's system enables warrantless tracking of people nationwide without accountability using
                Automated License Plate Readers or ALPRs. Despite this company's young age, this system has already been used to stalk, wrongly accuse, 
                and incorrectly arrest people around the country in just a few short years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flock's cameras and systems have been demonstrated to have security flaws, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations. 
                The company sends our surveillance data overseas to be used to train their AI.  The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/surveillance-company-flock-now-using-ai-to-report-us-to-police-if-it-thinks-our-movement-patterns-are-suspicious" target="_blank">ACLU</a> has also reported that Flock's AI will be used to report suspicious location patterns to police.  Flock refuses to allow their terms and conditions
                to be archived by archive.org and changes them surreptitiously.  Flock has tried and recently <a href="https://haveibeenflocked.com/news/cyble-part5" target="_blank">failed to silence</a> 
                a valuable resource in our fight, <a href="HaveIBeenFlocked.com" target="_blank">HaveIBeenFlocked.com</a>, by abusing 
                takedown mechanisms.  Without HaveIBeenFlocked, Deflock Joplin would not have been created.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a surface level overview of a few of the issues with the company our City has entered into business with.
            </p>            

            <P>The Joplin Police Department has no publicly available policies about this system. The only possibly related policy is for <em>mobile</em> license plate readers.  This policy does not address the issues inherent with Flock's system. Every Flock contract also has the option to activate a transparency portal for free. If JPD has activated this portal, we cannot locate it.  Our records request for this portal address has so far not been addressed.</P>
            <P>The Joplin Police Department also <a href="facts.html#SharingReport">shares</a> our location data with agencies geographically dispersed across the nation, even if they are not returning the favor.  Our records request for the sharing agreement that JPD requires other agencies to conform to has so far not been addressed.</P>
            <p>
                We’re focusing on transparency, public record requests, and community dialogue with local
                officials.  We currently have received partial records from Joplin and are awaiting records 
                from other nearby cities.  We intend to share findings from this data once we analyze it
                and make it easily readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Joplin's cameras are a small piece of a massive surveillance network built without our consent or knowledge.  Watch this space for sources, events, and organizing information.

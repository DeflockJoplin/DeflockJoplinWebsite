        <h2>BREAKING NEWS</h2>
        <p>If you're arriving here for the first time due to the news about a JPD Officer's abuse of Flock, we believe we are responsible for the discovery of this abuse.  Check out our <a href="./posts/2026-01-08-JPD-Audit.html">partial audit</a> of Joplin Police Department's use of Flock for more information about what we found. We also have a timeline of events, including our records requests, on our <a href="facts.html">facts page.</a> We will have a full deconstruction of the City's press release next week, but until then please see our immediate response below:</p>
        <h2>Reaction to the City's Release</h2>
        <p>We at Deflock Joplin have seen the release from the City regarding the misuse of Flock by an officer.  We are concerned that the city's response does not address several key concerns we have raised.</p>
        <o><li>We are concerned about how this product came to be in our city.  We have been unable to find council adoption of the Flock contract and The City has been unable to produce it to us. We have inquired about the purchase processes in the city, but have not received clarification.</li>
        <li>We are concerned about the duration of the breach of this system.  The city failed to disclose this went on for <strong>14 months</strong> based on our records. CJIS standards mandate regular audits of systems like this. We are also concerned about the Police Department's CJIS status as a result of this breach.</li>
        <li>We are concerned the city did not disclose how this breach was discovered.  We have strong reason to believe it was our records requests about the officer's name and the plates being abused, <strong>in their plain text form</strong>, that triggered this action.  We have been aware of this activity since October 2025.</li>
        <li>We are concerned that we have been unable to find a policy regarding the use of Flock or similar location tracking LPRs.  JPD only has a policy for the plate readers on their cars, which do not have any of the privacy concerns Flock does. The City has also been unable to produce this to us.</li>
        </o>
        <p>We are still processing news, records requests, and gathering new information.  We will have more to say on this issue in the future. </p>
        <P>Update 1/11/2026: We have noticed that Joplin's official response to this issue indicates they were able to access California license plate data in violation of a 10 year old plate sharing law.  We have inquired about how this is possible.</P>
        <h2> Area Coverage</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.fourstateshomepage.com/news/local/ex-joplin-police-officer-accused-of-misusing-police-resources/">KODE - Ex-Joplin police officer accused of misusing police resources </a> </p>
        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>
            Our goal is to inform residents about Flock and other surveillance so that they may act to protect their privacy.  This system 
            was installed in Joplin with hardly a peep.  If you look, you'll find no news stories and <a href="../posts/2026-01-03-Joplin-Contract-Mystery.html">few traces</a> in council records about Flock's installation.  
            In fact, the official response from the city to our records request included no information from council records about Flock and continues to as of their latest "production" of records on 01/09/2026.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe Flock's system is inappropriate in a free and open democracy and should be removed from our city.  The city has also failed to be transparent
            along the way and should be scrutinized for their implementation of this system.
        </p>
        <div id="Why">
            <h2>What Are We Doing and Why?</h2>
            <p>            
                Flock Safety's system enables warrantless tracking of people nationwide without accountability using
                Automated License Plate Readers or ALPRs. Despite this company's young age, this system has already been used to stalk, wrongly accuse, 
                and incorrectly arrest people around the country in just a few short years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flock's cameras and systems have been demonstrated to have security flaws, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations. 
                The company sends our surveillance data overseas to be used to train their AI.  The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/surveillance-company-flock-now-using-ai-to-report-us-to-police-if-it-thinks-our-movement-patterns-are-suspicious" target="_blank">ACLU</a> has also reported that Flock's AI will be used to report suspicious location patterns to police.  Flock refuses to allow their terms and conditions
                to be archived by archive.org and changes them surreptitiously.  Flock has tried and recently <a href="https://haveibeenflocked.com/news/cyble-part5" target="_blank">failed to silence</a> 
                a valuable resource in our fight, <a href="https://HaveIBeenFlocked.com" target="_blank">HaveIBeenFlocked.com</a>, by abusing 
                takedown mechanisms.  Without HaveIBeenFlocked, Deflock Joplin would not have been created. Without HaveIBeenFlocked, we would not have found and then investigated the abuses of Plate 1 and Plate 2 in our <a href="./posts/2026-01-08-JPD-Audit.html">partial audit</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a surface level overview of a few of the issues with the company our City has entered into business with.
            </p>            

            <P>The Joplin Police Department has no publicly available policies about this system. The only possibly related policy is for <em>mobile</em> license plate readers.  This policy does not address the issues inherent with Flock's system. Our request for this policy has again been ignored in the latest production on 1/09/2026. </P>
            <p>Every Flock contract also has the option to activate a transparency portal for free. If JPD has activated this portal, we cannot locate it.  Our records request for this portal address continues to not be addressed as of 01/09/2026, but for some reason the city is now responding to a "request" we did not make about "analytics" which we find very interesting.</P>
            <P>The Joplin Police Department also <a href="facts.html#SharingReport">shares</a> our location data with agencies geographically dispersed across the nation, even if they are not returning the favor.  Our records request for the sharing agreement that JPD requires other agencies to conform was initially not addressed, but the City has finally admitted on 1/09/2026 that they have no standard for sharing with other cities or for holding other cities accountable for their searches of our location data.</P>
            <p>We have now released a <a href="./posts/2026-01-08-JPD-Audit.html">partial audit</a> of the Joplin Police Department log data and have grave concerns.</p>
            <p>
                We’re focusing on transparency, public record requests, and community dialogue with local
                officials.  We currently have received partial records from Joplin and are awaiting records 
                from other nearby cities.  We intend to share findings from this data once we analyze it
                and make it easily readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Joplin's cameras are a small piece of a massive surveillance network built without our consent or knowledge.  Watch this space for sources, events, and organizing information.

        <h2>Welcome and Goal</h2>
        <p>
            First, let us extend a warm welcome! Please excuse the bareness of this site.  
            This is a very basic launch and more will be added soon.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Flock Safety's system enables warrantless tracking of people nationwide without accountability.  
            Despite this company's young age, this system has already been used to stalk, wrongly accuse, 
            and incorrectly arrest people around the country in just a few short years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to inform residents about Flock and other surveillance so that residents may act to protect their privacy.  This system 
            was installed in Joplin with hardly a peep.  If you look, you'll find no news stories and few traces in council records about Flock's installation.  
            In fact, the official response from the city to our records request included no information from council records about Flock.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe Flock's system is inappropriate in a free and open democracy and should be removed from our city.

                We’re focusing on transparency, public record requests, and community dialogue with local
                officials.  We currently have received partial records from Joplin and are awaiting records 
                from other nearby cities.  We intend to share findings from this data once we analyze it
                and make it easily readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flock's cameras and systems have been demonstrated to have security flaws, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations. 
                The company sends our surveillance data overseas to be used to train their AI.  Flock refuses to allow their terms and conditions
                to be archived by archive.org and changes them surreptitiously.  Flock is currently <a href="https://haveibeenflocked.com/news/cyble-part3" target="_blank">attempting to silence</a> 
                a valuable resource in our fight, <a href="HaveIBeenFlocked.com" target="_blank">HaveIBeenFlocked.com</a>, by abusing 
                takedown mechanisms.  Without HaveIBeenFlocked, Deflock Joplin would not have been created.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a surface level overview of a few of the issues with the company our City has entered into business with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Joplin's cameras are a small piece of a massive surveillance network built without our consent or knowledge.  Watch this space for more information on events and organizing.

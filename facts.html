        <h2>Joplin's Flock Timeline</h2>

        <!-- Replace the placeholder paragraph(s) with your own fact content -->
        <p>12/7/2023 - Joplin's first contract with Flock Safety was signed for a total of $154,200 over five years. A review of records by Deflock Joplin
            has so far not been able to find a corresponding council vote or approval of this contract. Our first records
            request included a request for council documents.  None have been provided as of 1/1/2026.</p>
        <p>12/11/2023 - PO 440832 entered with Req. date of 12/8/23 for the first year of the contract</p>
        <p>02/12/24 - Council reviews the Benchmark and Level of Service Analysis.  In the analysis document, an employee survey was described in which LPRs
            are requested by at least one employee. LPRs are not a discussion topic in the council.</p>
        <p>02/29/2024- Chief Pearson gives a presentation to the City Council regarding 2024 Goals and Initiatives for Joplin's police department. 
            The chief made no mention of Flock or ALPRs in this presentation. Topics included take home police cars, a police social worker, and 
            a downtown patrol.</p>
        <p>04/02/2024 - Key Initiatives Update in email traffic references completion of purchase of 10 cameras.</p>
        <p>05/13/2024 - This is the first mention Deflock Joplin has found of LPR purchases in council records. In the work session packet for this date, 
            a line states "License Plate Readers were authorized and have been purchased (10)." Chief Peason, talking about the system, says it's effectively like having "police eyes"
            at those locations 24 hours a day. Mayor Detar said he was not familiar with ALPRs before this, but offered no questions.  Councilmember Bard asks 
            if more cameras will be added if the cameras do well.  Chief responds yes.</p>
        <p>12/9/2024 - second contract signed for two cameras, adding $6,300/year. This contract also moved the terms and conditions of the contract to a
            website that Flock updates without warning and does not allow Archive.org to archive.</p>
        <p>4/10/25 - PO 453026 entered with req data of 3/24/25.  Year 1 subscription for two Flock cameras, $6,300. PO 453027 entered with req data of 3/26/25.
            Year 2 subscription for 10 flock cameras, $30,000.</p>
        <p>4/18/2025 - JPD received quote for eight additional cameras and a Flock Drone as First Responder system.</p>
        <p>11/25/25 - First records request filed by Deflock Joplin</p>
        <p>12/2/25 - Deposit of $161.05 requested by the City.</p>
        <p>12/4/25 - Depost paid by Deflock Joplin</p>
        <p>12/19/25 - First production of files by Joplin. Deflock Joplin replied within two hours objecting to redactions, destroyed data, and
        items not responded to.</p>
        <p>12/26/25 - Objection follow up sent</p>
        <p>12/28/25 - Separate records request filed for information on specific plates found in audit logs from the first records request.</p>
        <p>12/29/25 - Response received for second request.  The City only acknowledged objections to first request after Deflock Joplin replied to this response 
            requesting an update.</p>

        <h2>Joplin's Flock Timeline</h2>
        <p>This is a reconstruction of Flock's implementation timeline we have been able to piece together from public records and records requests.</p>
        <p>12/7/2023 - Joplin's first contract with Flock Safety was signed for a total of $154,200 over five years. A review of records by Deflock Joplin
            has so far not been able to find a corresponding council vote or approval of this contract. Our first records
            request included a request for council documents.  None have been provided as of 1/1/2026.</p>
        <p>12/11/2023 - PO 440832 entered with Req. date of 12/8/23 for the first year of the contract</p>
        <p>02/12/2024 - Council reviews the Benchmark and Level of Service Analysis.  In the analysis document, an employee survey was described in which LPRs
            are requested by at least one employee. LPRs are not a discussion topic in the council.</p>
        <p>02/29/2024- Chief Pearson gives a presentation to the City Council regarding 2024 Goals and Initiatives for Joplin's police department. 
            The chief made no mention of Flock or ALPRs in this presentation. Topics included take home police cars, a police social worker, and 
            a downtown patrol.</p>
        <p>04/02/2024 - Key Initiatives Update in email traffic references completion of purchase of 10 cameras.</p>
        <p>05/13/2024 - This is the first mention Deflock Joplin has found of LPR purchases in council records. In the work session packet for this date, 
            a line states "License Plate Readers were authorized and have been purchased (10)." Chief Pearson, talking about the system, says it's effectively like having "police eyes"
            at those locations 24 hours a day. Mayor Detar said he was not familiar with ALPRs before this, but offered no questions.  Councilmember Bard asks 
            if more cameras will be added if the cameras do well.  Chief responds yes.</p>
        <p>12/9/2024 - second contract signed for two cameras, adding $6,300/year. This contract also moved the terms and conditions of the contract to a
            website that Flock updates without warning and does not allow Archive.org to archive.</p>
        <p>4/10/2025 - PO 453026 entered with req date of 3/24/25.  Year 1 subscription for two Flock cameras, $6,300. PO 453027 entered with req data of 3/26/25.
            Year 2 subscription for 10 flock cameras, $30,000.</p>
        <p>4/18/2025 - JPD received a quote for <strong>eight additional cameras and a Flock Drone</strong> as First Responder system.</p>
        <p><strong>11/25/2025 - First records request filed</strong> by Deflock Joplin. We had already seen patterns of <a href="/posts/2026-01-08-JPD-Audit.html">abuse</a> on plates 1 & 2 and wanted to see what the city would allow us to see.</p>
        <p>12/2/2025 - Deposit of $161.05 requested by the City.</p>
        <p>12/4/2025 - Deposit paid by Deflock Joplin</p>
        <p>12/19/2025 - First production of files by The City. Deflock Joplin replied just over two hours later objecting to redactions, destroyed data, and
            items not responded to.</p>
        <p>12/26/2025 - Follow up to Objections sent.</p>
        <p>12/29/2025 - Deflock Joplin filed a very pointed records request about Plates 1 & 2 and the officer searching them in our audit logs. The city clerk replied they were in receipt.  No update to our objections were provided until asked in this reply. Vague promise to produce files "as soon as possible."</p>
        <P>1/1/2025 5:00 PM Follow up sent requesting a Sunshine Law compliant time estimate and reason for delay. </P> 
        <p>1/2/2025 - City promises to produce files by end of 1/9 citing holidays and staffing issues.</p>
        <p>1/9/2025 - City pulls a fast one that will require an entire section of a post to explain. Stay tuned. </p>

    <h1>JPD's Sharing Report</h1>
    <p>This shows the external agency on the left and what they're sharing with Joplin in the middle. Sometimes multiple networks are shared from one agency and you will see multiple entries in the middle.  If that agency can search Joplin's cameras, "JOPLIN MO PD" will appear in the right hand column. The scope of this system's tracking capability is vast. You will notice there are multiple pages of agencies that can search our city's data, but JPD cannot search theirs.</p>
